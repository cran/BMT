Description: Density, distribution, quantile function, random number generation for the BMT (Bezier-Montenegro-Torres) distribution. Torres-Jimenez C.J. and Montenegro-Diaz A.M. (2017) <arXiv:1709.05534>. Moments, descriptive measures and parameter conversion for different parameterizations of the BMT distribution. Fit of the BMT distribution to non-censored data by maximum likelihood, moment matching, quantile matching, maximum goodness-of-fit, also known as minimum distance, maximum product of spacing, also called maximum spacing, and minimum quantile distance, which can also be called maximum quantile goodness-of-fit. Fit of univariate distributions for non-censored data using maximum product of spacing estimation and minimum quantile distance estimation is also included.
